Intro to GRACE-FO Tutorials
############################################################################################

The tutorials in this series use GRACE-FO Mascon dataset with the Coastline Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter (Level 3 data generated at Jet Propulsion Laboratory). The mascon file is available to download from PODAAC webpage. Currently the tutorials can read the file from local directory or from PODAAC cloud based on the option users provide. Users can download latest mascon dataset and update the filename as well as start date and end date according to their preferences.

The tutorials have been written under Open Science Initiatives and aim to provide working examples to users on how to use GRACE-FO  monthly Level 3 gridded data. Users can read the handbook section on Level 3 use cases. These use cases have been further elaborated in appendix A-D. Lastly, the code for these use cases have been provided as Jupyter Notebooks and standalone python scripts. (Note: We will soon update the Notebooks for other use cases). While users are encouraged to download the notebooks and run them. The option to create a temporary online python environment to run these notebooks is also provided using Binder. Clicking on the binder links will open a binder page with a python environment where users can run this notebook while editing things like start date, end date and plot layout etc. It may take 5-6 minutes to fully create the environment once binder link is clicked.   

Colorado river basin notebook
=======================================

For this tutorial a shapefile is available in the GRACE_RESOURCES subdirectory and users can take a look at any other region of interest and perform the basin mean calculations for any region by providing its layer_name in the script.
